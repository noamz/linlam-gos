# Linear lambda calculus and graphs on surfaces

This repository gathers some code and data for exploring the
combinatorics of linear lambda calculus and its connections to the
theory of graphs on surfaces.  Besides browsing the
[source code](src/), you can also:

* Look at [related OEIS entries](doc/oeis.md)
* See [bibliographic references](doc/refs.md)

Some other resources:

* Jason Reed's [lambda-maps repository](https://github.com/jcreedcmu/lambda-maps).
