# Linear lambda calculus and graphs on surfaces

It turns out that linear lambda calculus has some surprising
connections to the theory of graphs on surfaces (for background, check
out these [bibliographic references](doc/refs.md)).  The purpose of
this repository is to gather some data and code for helping to
navigate these connections.  For now, you can:

* Look at [OEIS entries of interest](doc/oeis.md)
* Browse the [source code](src/)
